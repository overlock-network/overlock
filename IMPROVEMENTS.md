# Overlock Codebase Improvement Plan

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the Overlock project based on a thorough analysis of the codebase.

## Executive Summary

Overlock demonstrates solid architectural foundations with good CLI design and modular structure. However, it has critical gaps in testing infrastructure and some security concerns that require immediate attention. The project follows Go best practices in most areas but needs standardization in error handling and dependency management.

## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 1. Testing Infrastructure - **CRITICAL**
**Current State:** No test files exist in the entire codebase.

**Impact:**
